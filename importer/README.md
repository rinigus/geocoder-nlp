Import program and scripts.

Import program is using moodified libosmscout library that can be installed
by `install_deps.sh` script. 

To generate larger amount of missing tags for the input map stylesheet
and whitelist, the scripts under `scripts/tags` (from main directory
of the project) can be used.
